# Using Computer Vision and Diffusion Models to Create Synthetic Images Enhancing Image Classifiers
Leveraged a variety of generative models—including GANs, VAEs, DVAEs, VQ-VAEs, diffusion models, and CLIP-guided diffusion—to enhance classifier performance on the FashionMNIST dataset. Achieved a 50% increase in accuracy on a highly imbalanced dataset limited to just 1,000 images. Conducted latent space analysis and observed a lack of correlation between CNN classification accuracy and embedding separability.
